This is a modified version of [node-milight-promise](https://github.com/mwittig/node-milight-promise) intended to work with React Native. It uses [react-native-udp](https://github.com/tradle/react-native-udp) instead of `dgram`, as well as `require('buffer').Buffer` instead of global `Buffer`. For original docs see [node-milight-promise](https://github.com/mwittig/node-milight-promise)
